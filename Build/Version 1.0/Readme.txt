Don't touch vocabulary.txt or else the programme might get buggy.

and if you have touched the vocabulary.txt then just delete and create a new .txt file called vocabulary.txt
but your list will be deleted.

If you don't have a vocabulary.txt to begin with just create a vocabulary.txt on the same directory as main.exe
